# Weather App

## Getting Started

The website is deployed at https://gtgtcode.github.io/weather-app. The website will ask for your location, so that you will not have to type in your current location in the search bar. If location is denied, it will default to Richmond, VA. To search for a location, type in the city, the state abbreviation, and click the search button.
